Step by Step Data Analysis with Machine Learning Model
1. Imports require library (Setup)
2. Providing the data (Download/Import Dataset) 
3. Explore the data (Understand the Data; clean,prepare and manipulate the data)
4. Build the model (Choose a model/ Generate predictions using patterns)
5. Model needs a loss function and an optimizer for training (compute error known as Loss Function and modified function)
6. Train the model
7. Evalute the model (See how the model performs? /testing the model)
8. Improving the Performance
