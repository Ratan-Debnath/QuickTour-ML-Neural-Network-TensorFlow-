Step by Step Data Analysis with Machine Learning Model--------
1. Imports require library (Setup environment)
2. Providing the data (Download/Import Dataset, Gather Data) 
3. Explore the data (Understand the Data)
4. Choose a model (Generate predictions using this patterns)
5. Prepare the data (Clean,prepare and manipulate the data)
6. Build the model
7. Model needs a loss function and an optimizer for training (compute error known as Loss Function and modified function)
8. Train the model
9. Evalute the model (See how the model performs? /testing the model)
10. Improving the Performance
